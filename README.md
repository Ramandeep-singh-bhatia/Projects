# Projects

This repository contains a collection of academic projects completed during my Master’s program, focusing on distributed systems, data analysis, and algorithm design. These projects demonstrate my ability to work with diverse programming paradigms, analyze large datasets, and implement efficient algorithms using industry-relevant tools and languages.

Each project folder contains the source code, documentation (if available), and a detailed explanation of the problem being solved.

## 📘 Project List

### 1. 🚀 Gossip & Push Sum Simulator (Sep 2020 – Nov 2020)

**Language:** F#  
**Domain:** Distributed Systems, Actor Model, Network Topologies

This project simulates the convergence behavior of two distributed algorithms:

- **Gossip Algorithm** for information dissemination  
- **Push-Sum Algorithm** for sum computation

Key Features:
- Implemented using the **actor model** in F#
- Simulates message passing between nodes in various network topologies:
  - Full Network
  - 2D Grid
  - Line
  - Imperfect 2D (with random neighbor)
- Demonstrates how convergence time varies based on topology and message-passing strategies

👉 Useful for understanding fault tolerance and message propagation in distributed systems.

### 2. 📊 Bitcoin Transactions Data Analysis (Jan 2020 – Apr 2020)

**Language/Tools:** Python, Pandas, Jupyter, SQLite  
**Domain:** Big Data, Financial Analysis, Data Science

Analyzed a **65 GB dataset** of Bitcoin transactions to uncover patterns and metrics at the address level.

Highlights:
- Identified addresses with the highest Bitcoin holdings
- Computed:
  - Average balance per address
  - Average number of input and output transactions per address
- Utilized **SQLite** for querying large volumes of transactional data efficiently
- Leveraged **Pandas** and **Jupyter Notebooks** for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization

👉 A strong demonstration of handling large-scale data and extracting meaningful financial insights.

### 3. 🏗️ Rising Building (Aug 2019 – Dec 2019)

**Language:** Java  
**Domain:** Algorithm Design, Scheduling, Data Structures

Designed and implemented an algorithm to optimize the scheduling of construction tasks with cost constraints.

Highlights:
- Implemented **Min Heap** for scheduling logic based on deadlines and cost priorities
- Used **Red-Black Tree** to manage dynamically arriving building requests
- Ensured efficient processing and retrieval of active tasks
- Solves a variant of the construction scheduling problem commonly encountered in systems design and planning

👉 Emphasizes algorithmic thinking, data structure knowledge, and Java fluency.
